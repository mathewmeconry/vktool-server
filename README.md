## Config

All configs are done in the files in the config folder.  
They can also be overwritten with then `NODE_CONFIG` environment variable.  
For more information see https://www.npmjs.com/package/config

Exception from this rule is the Typeorm configuration.   
You can see an example configuration in the file `.env.example`
